# Binary Search Algorithm

A Python implementation of the binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array.

## Features
- Implements both iterative and recursive binary search.
- Validates that the input array is sorted.
- Returns the index of the target element or indicates if not found.

## Files
- `binary_search.py`: Python script with iterative and recursive binary search.
- `test_binary_search.sh`: Bash script to test the implementation.

## Setup
1. Ensure Python3 is installed: `sudo apt install python3`.
2. Run the script: `python3 binary_search.py`.
3. Run tests: `bash test_binary_search.sh`.
